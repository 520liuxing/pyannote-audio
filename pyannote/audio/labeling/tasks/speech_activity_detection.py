class SpeechActivityDetectionGenerator(LabelingTaskGenerator):
    """Batch generator for training speech activity detection

    Parameters
    ----------
    feature_extraction : `pyannote.audio.features.FeatureExtraction`
        Feature extraction
    protocol : `pyannote.database.Protocol`
    subset : {'train', 'development', 'test'}
    frame_info : `pyannote.core.SlidingWindow`, optional
        Override `feature_extraction.sliding_window`. This is useful for
        models that include the feature extraction step (e.g. SincNet) and
        therefore output a lower sample rate than that of the input.
    frame_crop : {'center', 'loose', 'strict'}, optional
        Which mode to use when cropping labels. This is useful for models
        that include the feature extraction step (e.g. SincNet) and
        therefore use a different cropping mode. Defaults to 'center'.
    overlap : bool, optional
        Switch to 3 classes "non-speech vs. one speaker vs. 2+ speakers".
        Defaults to 2 classes "non-speech vs. speech".
    duration : float, optional
        Duration of sub-sequences. Defaults to 3.2s.
    batch_size : int, optional
        Batch size. Defaults to 32.
    per_epoch : float, optional
        Total audio duration per epoch, in days.
        Defaults to one day (1).
    parallel : int, optional
        Number of prefetching background generators. Defaults to 1.
        Each generator will prefetch enough batches to cover a whole epoch.
        Set `parallel` to 0 to not use background generators.
